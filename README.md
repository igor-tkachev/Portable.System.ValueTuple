This is a copy of the System.ValueTuple classes.
Standard nuget does not support some old frameworks. If you still need it, you can use this one.

Also if you do not need any dependencies, then just copy the Portable.System.ValueTuple.cs file into your project. 
In this case it will be compiled as an internal class an will not be conflicted with other packages.
